# True(t) or False(f): enable static emulator windows size and coordinates (position on screen):
f
# change these 4 numbers after turning static coordinates on (in line above)
# when static coordinates are turned on, program does not use cords.png

# True(t) or False(f): Enable debug mode, which shows additional info in log:
f
# True(t) or False(f): Load config_yourself.txt file content every iteration (roughly 10 seconds):
f
# This last option in line above might be useful to quickly tweak down "clocks" to low delays to make this program run faster
# By default (False) config_yourself.txt content is loaded only once when program starts
# Program works also when this file does not exist. Then it just works with default values
