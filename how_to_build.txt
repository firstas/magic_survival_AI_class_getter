It's all about running python code.
You can just install python interpreter.
To build .exe file I did everything asa described on this site: https://datatofish.com/executable-pyinstaller/
So as I had Python already installed, I just typed in command prompt 2 commands:
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --onefile AI_class_chooser.py
