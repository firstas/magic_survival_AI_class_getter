Program works on Windows (may work on other platforms, but didn't test it)
Any emulator is required, for example Bluestacks
---------------------------------------------------
(I recommend: in the game click Option -> Save -> Yes -> Go Back)
After every unsuccessful class research (almost every try), program loads data from cloud to retrieve gems
Every time you use the program, you have to:
1. Enter Shop and click Research Data for 20 gems (they will be retrieved by game's load feature)
2. Take screenshot of a brighter box with any class that appeared (check screenshot_area.png in this folder)
3. Save it exactly as "cords.png" in this folder (in current directory)
4. Run MSClassGetter.exe (by double clicking it)
5. Pay attention to don't allow any program window cover game window while MSClassGetter.exe is working
(program constantly takes screenshot of the middle game area to recognize classes)
Screenshot which you saved at the beginning is used as source of information about screen coordinates,
so you have to take it and save before every program start.
---------------------------------------------------
How to solve problems:
If program clicks in wrong places, it probably means that screenshot was taken unprecisely (check screenshot_area.png in this folder)
---------------------------------------------------
Additional info:
Don't resize or change game window position when program is running.
You can change them after stopping program.
To stop running program, click program's window and from keyboard Ctrl + C
You have to do it quickly;)
Program will also stop when given requirements are met.
(NN_save.txt keeps saved neural network data and .exe needs it to work)
Thanks for using my program, feedback is appreciated;)
